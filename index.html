  <!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="section section--about">
  <h2>About</h2>
 <div class="prose">
    <p>At Frontline Reception, we were founded with one mission — to restore genuine, reliable customer service to businesses that have suffered from the rise of off-shore and remote operations. Too many companies have seen their customer experience decline as calls go unanswered, messages are missed, and clients feel unheard. We built Frontline Reception to change that.<p>

    <p>Our promise is simple: every call is answered, every customer is understood, and no opportunity is ever lost. We believe that real communication — handled by trained, local professionals — is the foundation of lasting business success.<p>


    <p>Our employees are never remote freelancers. They are local, in-house specialists who work in our professional office environment — fully trained, carefully supervised, and consistently monitored to ensure the highest standards of performance and accountability. Every call is handled from our desks, on our systems, during structured business hours, with full managerial oversight.<p>


    <p>We’ve also solved another major challenge businesses face: the constant rotation and turnover of employees. In many workplaces, talented new graduates move on quickly — getting married, starting families, and reducing their hours without reducing their pay. The result is burnout, inconsistency, and costly retraining.<p>


    <p>At Frontline Reception, we take a different approach. We recruit from a highly dedicated sector of women returning to the workforce whose children are now in school, giving them stable hours and renewed purpose. These women bring maturity, reliability, and focus to their roles. Even when they start without direct industry experience, we recognize potential — and invest in it. We provide complete, hands-on training until each employee becomes a confident, capable professional who represents your company with pride.<p>


    <p>To ensure quality and continuity, we train several employees on each client account. This allows for flexible scheduling, prevents burnout, and guarantees that service never stops — even if one team member is unavailable. When we take on your company, we conduct a thorough, detailed onboarding process with the full team, ensuring that multiple professionals are prepared to handle your calls, tasks, and customer needs seamlessly — all for one consistent weekly price.<p>


    <p>At Frontline Reception, every call is answered by a real person — present, trained, and accountable. Never remote. Always professional. Always managed.<p>


    <p>Frontline Reception: Real people. Real service. Right here at home.</p>
